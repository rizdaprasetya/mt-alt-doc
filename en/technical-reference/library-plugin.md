<summary><b>Note on Community Contributed Libraries</b></summary>
<article>

As Midtrans does not maintain the community contributed libraries, therefore Midtrans is not liable and may not be able to specifically help with the issue you may encounter during the usage of them. You can attempt to contact the contributors/community should you have any questions.

Although open source contributed codes are relatively safe & transparently peer-reviewed, you may want to do your own review of the code integrity before using any external provided codes.

#### How to Run Sample Codes Quickly & Easily

?> ***Tips:*** You can use [Gitpod.io](https://www.gitpod.io/) to easily run our sample codes. Gitpod is like a temporary cloud VM/VPS/container (with proper UI) that you can use to manage & run codes/web-servers easily. You don't need to install or download anything on your own machine, run it on their cloud!

Here's how:
- Go to [Gitpod.io](https://www.gitpod.io/), and sign-up/sign-in for a free account.
	- You can easily sign-in with Github account.
- Then on your web browser, type `https://gitpod.io#`, then paste Midtrans' example repo url at the end of the url.
	- E.g. open this url on your browser: https://gitpod.io#https://github.com/Midtrans/midtrans-nodejs-client/
- Then you will be given access to a cloud IDE, that have its own code-editor UI & terminal/shell that you can use to browse/edit the code & run the codes/examples.
- You can `cd` to the `/examples` folder and follow the instruction.
	- e.g. for NodeJS example, you can `cd /examples/expressApp` then run the example with `npm install; npm start;`. The example web server will run and you can click open browser/preview, to browse it as a web user.

That's it!
