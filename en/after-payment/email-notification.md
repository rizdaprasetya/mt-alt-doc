# Email Notification
<hr>
Whenever transaction status changes (success, failure, cancel, and so on), Midtrans sends email notification to Merchant email (email configured on Dashboard) & Customer email (email provided on Snap payment page). 
This instant email notification is helpful especially if an immediate action is required on any transaction.

To see and test this feature, feel free to create a transaction in Sandbox mode and check the email notification sent to your inbox.

You can configure the email notification settings at [Settings - Email Notification](https://dashboard.sandbox.midtrans.com/settings/email_notifications) in Dashboard.

?> To send notifications to multiple email ids, use comma as a separator. Example : `me@tokoecomm.com, you@tokoecomm.com`
