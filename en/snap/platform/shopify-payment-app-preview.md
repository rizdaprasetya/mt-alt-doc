# Integrate Midtrans Snap to 3rd Party Ecommerce Platform
<hr>

Midtrans Snap can be integrated with third party E-commerce platform or SaaS like Shopify, Sirclo, and Jejualan. 

Midtrans is partnered with various platforms to make integration process as easy as possible. This page contains a list of platforms that have partnered with Midtrans. If you are using third party platforms that are not listed here, and would like for Midtrans to integrate with it, please contact us at [support@midtrans.com](mailto:support@midtrans.com "email support")

Step by step guide to integrate Snap to the platform of your choice, is explained below. 

## Shopify

?> As [announced by Shopify](https://shopify.dev/apps/payments/hosted-payment-sdk), Shopify planned to deprecate the previous payment integration platform (Hosted Payment SDK) by June 30, 2022. Shopify has urged Midtrans (and other payment gateways) to migrate to their new [Payment Platform integration](https://shopify.dev/beta/payments-apps/). In compliance with it, Midtrans has migrated to the new platform, as a result of the new platform, __you__ as a __Midtrans’ merchants will need to migrate by installing Midtrans as Shopify Payment App__.<br><br>
__If by June 30, 2022 you have not done so__, Midtrans payment integration (installed using the previous platform) __may no longer work for your Shopify store__.<br><br>
Due to the changes introduced by Shopify’s new payment platform, there are some changes (compared to previous integration version) and limitations that should be expected. Visit [Known Limitations](#known-limitations) under Advanced section to see the details.

Please complete the steps given below:

1. Create an online store with [Shopify](https://shopify.com) if you haven't.
2. Register for [Midtrans account](https://dashboard.midtrans.com/register).
3. Complete the account registration form. For any help, you can contact [Midtrans activation team](mailto:activation@midtrans.com). Use **SHOPIFY - URL Name** as a subject header and mention your registered _Midtrans Merchant ID_.

Note: 

- You can try with Shopify Trial plan to test payment integration in *Sandbox mode*. 
- You may be required by Shopify to have an active paid-plan in order to allow your customer to do checkout on *Production mode*.

<summary>Matching Order ID Between Shopify and Midtrans</summary>
<article>
Order ID created on Midtrans Dashboard for each transaction is based from payment-id auto generated by Shopify platform, to ensure uniqueness per transaction. It can be different with the order id shown on Shopify platform.

To find order on Shopify platform, based on Order ID from Midtrans, first find the transaction Order ID from Midtrans *Dashboard* on **Transactions**.
![shopify](./../../../asset/image/shopify-new-17-order-id-on-midtrans.png ':size=400')

##### From Order menu
1. On your Shopify admin area (administration page), go to __Orders__. 
2. In the search bar, search using the custom term **receipt.payment_id:** and the **order ID** value from Midtrans. For example: **receipt.payment_id:order_id_from_midtrans**
3. Click on the shown order.

<summary>Customize Shopify Order Confirmation Email Template</summary>
<article>

When customer is proceeding to check out from your Shopify store into Midtrans Snap payment page, order is "confirmed" on Shopify side, and they will send "order confirmation" email notification to customer.

But you may find the wording of the email is confusing for customer, for example: 
> Hi John, we're getting your order ready to be shipped. We will notify you when it has been sent.

You may notice that email is being sent **before customer completes the payment**, so it may not be true that the order is ready for shipping, **the order needs to be paid first**. Unfortunately that's how the default Shopify "order confirmation notification" behavior works. We can try to customize the message to be less confusing. 

Shopify explained how to customize notification [on their documentation here](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/sell-online/notifications/edit-template). We try to summarize it for you.

1. Login to your Shopify admin page.
2. Go to `Settings > Notifications`.
3. Click `Order Confirmation`.
4. Search for `{% capture email_body %}` text.
5. Input or copy this sentence just below/after that text:
```
If you have completed your payment, then you are done. If you have not completed your payment, please complete it soon to avoid auto-cancelation.<br><br>
```
You can customize the message to your own preference. Or even modify it as "payment reminder".
![shopify](./../../../asset/image/shopify-18.png ':size=400')
6. Click `Save`. You can also `Preview` the email.
7. Done.

<summary>Additional Notes</summary>
<article>

##### Cancel and Refund via Shopify admin panel
Within Shopify admin panel's order details view, there are actions of `cancel` and `refund`. When triggering `cancel` or `refund`, Midtrans order status will try to sync with the Shopify status, if it met the criteria for payment cancel or refund.

For example:
- Refunding `paid` order on Shopify, will also make Midtrans order status to be marked as `refund`/`cancel`.

Limitations:
- Not all payment methods support online `refund` on Midtrans side, capability is mostly limited to Card & e-money/QRIS transaction.
- Will only works if your Midtrans account is allowed to trigger online refund.
- Shopify's refund UI/UX can be a little bit confusing, after clicking refund it may not tell you whether the refund is successful or not. It only shows `refund processing` which **should not be confused as an indication of success**. You can follow the refund status from the Shopify Order’s timeline. If it is marked as `pending` or failure, the refund is not successful.
- It is more recommended to manage payment refund & cancellation from Midtrans Dashboard instead. As it will have a better indication of refund success and failure.
- `cancel` or `refund` action triggered on Midtrans dashboard/API, may or may not be synced to Shopify due to some limitation.

?> The more accurate payment status is the one shown on Midtrans dashboard. You should refer to it in case there are discrepancies on Shopify's side. Because in some rare case payment status syncing to Shopify's system may fail, and Shopify's order details UI can be confusing to read.

##### Note on Canceling Order
Canceling a paid order will auto trigger attempt to refund/cancel payment on Payment Gateway (Midtrans) side. That is the flow of Shopify that Merchant and Payment Gateway follows. Please avoid canceling a paid order when you mean to edit/customize the item or size.

As per Shopify docs, `cancel order` are not supposed to be used to change item/size:
https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/orders/refund-cancel-order#cancel-an-order

Merchants supposed to `edit order` if they need to change the item/size:
https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/orders/edit-orders

Or archive the order, if they really need to remove it from order list:
https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/orders/manage-orders#archive-a-fulfilled-order

##### Item Stock & Status
Few points to understand about order status & item stock management that is managed automatically with this integration:
- Item stock will be reduced whenever order status become `pending` on Shopify side.
- Item stock will be reduced immediately after the customer reaches Snap payment page, regardless of whether he/she will proceed to actual payment or not. This is to prevent "oversell" issue, by reserving the item stock for the duration of this payment. 
  - Example of "oversell" issue prevented by this mechanism: This happens when item stock is 1 left, but there are 2 (or more) customers racing to complete the payment, if both complete the payments, and both are accepted by Shopify, then the item stock will be negative. Which will cause issues on its own. So to prevent this, item stock is reserved (and marked as pending on Shopify side) as early as the customer is redirected to the payment page.
- Card transaction with `deny` status will be updated as failed on Shopify by Midtrans after two hours if left without any success attempt. If success pay attempt is found, it will be updated as success on Shopify.
- Abandoned Snap payment page (customer left without proceeding with any payment method) will be updated as expired on Shopify after two hours. Order may not show up in Midtrans Dashboard.
- When customer reaches Snap payment page (status `pending` and stock reduced). Shopify may send email to customer which says "order ready to be shipped", although from Shopify side it is still waiting for payment. Refer to section above about this behavior.
- It is recommended to **avoid manual order status changes (manual intervention)** from Shopify Admin Panel at least between period of the order first created as `pending` and it finally become `paid/canceled` (about 0-26 hours), in order for payment integration with Midtrans to perform smoothly. Which the order status and item stock will be managed automatically based on the flow explained on this page.
  - Manual order status changes may cause unexpected behaviour in terms of order status & item stock management, such as order status stuck at certain state. Do this at your own risk. Midtrans may not be in position to help/explain with the consequences.

##### Basic Status Mapping
Condition | Midtrans Status | Shopify Payment Status
--- | --- | ---
Customer redirected to Snap payment page. | \- | Payment Pending
Customer proceeds with asynchronous payment <br>For example: Bank Transfer, Gopay. | Pending | Payment Pending
Customer proceeds with asynchronous payment <br>but does not pay until expiry time reached.<sup>[1]</sup> | Expire | Expired
Customer successfully makes payment. | Settlement/Capture | Paid
Customer abandoned Snap payment page <br>without proceeding with payment. | \- | Expired
Customer abandoned or denied card transaction. | Deny | Expired
Merchant cancels/refunds order via Shopify. | Cancel/Refund | Canceled/Refunded

<br>

<sup>[1]</sup> The expiry time calculation starts at the moment when the customer proceeds with the payment method (not necessarily from when redirected to Snap payment page). The payment expiry will then follow what is defined on Snap Preference for each payment method, you can [customize the Snap Preference](/en/after-payment/dashboard-usage.md#configuring-custom-payment-expiry-settings-on-snap) to your needs. When the payment expiry time is reached and the customer does not complete the payment, the transaction will be updated to `Expired` on Shopify side & `Expire` on Midtrans side.

#### Known Limitations
Due to the changes introduced by Shopify’s new payment platform, here are some changes (compared to previous integration version) and limitations that should be expected:

##### How can I integrate my store with the Midtrans Sandbox Environment?
To integrate your store with the Midtrans Sandbox environment, you will be required to install a separate/additional app (with similar steps of installation). We'll update our docs with the details once it is ready.

##### Is auto restock items upon abandoned payment still supported?
Unfortunately due to Shopify's new payment platform, "auto restock items upon abandoned payment" may not be available in this integration version. In previous integration, if a customer left the Snap payment page without proceeding with any payment method, order will be updated as canceled on Shopify after two hours, and will be restocked. For this new integration, restock is not yet available, for an alternative, you need to cancel the order manually from Shopify admin, to release the stock that previously was allocated for customers.

##### Is it possible to have each payment method displayed as a separate payment button on my store’s checkout page?
Unfortunately due to Shopify's new payment platform, this is no longer possible (unlike previous integration).

##### Is it possible to add more payment method icons to be displayed on the checkout page?
We are working and communicating with Shopify to try to add more payment method icons.

##### Is it possible to change the text-label of the payment button instead of the generic Midtrans Payment Gateway text?
In Shopify's new payment platform, this doesn’t seem to be possible.

##### Is there anything Midtrans plan to do about the missing features compared to previous integration?
We do understand your concern that you want to bring the best customer experience to your store, Midtrans indeed also share a similar vision. So we are trying to figure out if we can bring back those or similar features. However please note that Midtrans integration is strictly bound to the limitations & behaviors of Shopify's new payment platform, so most of the time we’ll also need to communicate with Shopify and need their support to improve on the limitations. We’ll update our docs when we have any improvements ready.

##### Is it possible to have card online installment & offline installment feature activated at the same time?
It is not currently possible to have both features activated, as activating both features may result in unexpected behavior regarding the installment acquirer result. Please choose only one of either feature activated.

##### As a Shopify store owner who already integrated with Midtrans using the previous integration method, what am I required to do?
According to Shopify’s mandate, you will be required to integrate using the current/new integration method, please follow the steps given in (Integrating Midtrans to Shopify Platform)[#integrating-midtrans-to-shopify-platform] section.

##### What will happen during the transition period where both integration methods can be installed? Anything else the store owner is required to do?
We are further clarifying with the Shopify team, we’ll update the docs once we have further details.

##### What will happen during the end of the transition period where the old integration method is deactivated? Anything else the store owner is required to do?
We are further clarifying with the Shopify team, we’ll update the docs once we have further details.
<hr>
