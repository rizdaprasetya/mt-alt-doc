<summary>Matching Order ID Between Shopify and Midtrans</summary>
<article>
Order ID created on Midtrans *Dashboard* for each transaction is based from reference auto generated by Shopify platform, to ensure uniqueness per transaction. It can be different with the order id shown on Shopify platform.

To find order on Shopify platform, based on Order ID from Midtrans, first find the transaction Order ID from Midtrans *Dashboard* on **Transactions**.
![shopify](./../../../asset/image/shopify-8.png ':size=400')

##### From Order menu
1. On your Shopify admin area (administration page), go to __Orders->All Orders__. 
2. In the search bar, input order id from Midtrans. 
3. Click on the shown order.

![shopify](./../../../asset/image/shopify-9.png ':size=400')

##### From General Search
1. On your Shopify admin area, there is general __search__ bar on top of the page.
2. In the search bar, input order id from Midtrans.
3. Click on the shown order.

![shopify](./../../../asset/image/shopify-10.png ':size=400')

##### Order detail
Inside the order found by the search result, you can see the reference number.

![shopify](./../../../asset/image/shopify-11.png ':size=400')

From the order details' `Timeline` you can also review the order status history. You can also click one of them to expand to see more details. You will see the Midtrans order ID shown as `Authorization Key` or `X Reference`.
![shopify](./../../../asset/image/shopify-20.png ':size=400')

?> Due to Shopify's payment UX flow which may allow 1 Shopify order to generate multiple payment id (order_id on Midtrans side), you may see multiple different `Authorization Key` or `X Reference` shown. Usually the most valid/recent one is the one from the latest (top-most) history shown on the Shopify’s order timeline.

Known case that may cause "1 Shopify order to generate multiple payment id (order_id on Midtrans side)":
- After customer did first payment attempt and reach Midtrans's payment page, merchant trigger `Resend Invoice` from Shopify's order page. This action will send email to the customer with another payment url. Which will generate another payment page (and another order_id) on Midtrans side.

You should avoid this scenario, if you find it cause a confusing situation.

##### From Exported Order
You can also find the reference number on the exported CSV file using Shopify export feature: __All Orders->Export->Export Orders.__ Then search within the CSV file.

<summary>Customize Shopify Order Confirmation Email Template</summary>
<article>

When customer is proceeding to check out from your Shopify store into Midtrans Snap payment page, order is "confirmed" on Shopify side, and they will send "order confirmation" email notification to customer.

But you may find the wording of the email is confusing for customer, for example: 
> Hi John, we're getting your order ready to be shipped. We will notify you when it has been sent.

You may notice that email is being sent **before customer completes the payment**, so it may not be true that the order is ready for shipping, **the order needs to be paid first**. Unfortunately that's how the default Shopify "order confirmation notification" behavior works. We can try to customize the message to be less confusing. 

Shopify explained how to customize notification [on their documentation here](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/sell-online/notifications/edit-template). We try to summarize it for you.

1. Login to your Shopify admin page.
2. Go to `Settings > Notifications`.
3. Click `Order Confirmation`.
4. Search for `{% capture email_body %}` text.
5. Input or copy this sentence just below/after that text:
```
If you have completed your payment, then you are done. If you have not completed your payment, please complete it soon to avoid auto-cancelation.<br><br>
```
You can customize the message to your own preference. Or even modify it as "payment reminder".
![shopify](./../../../asset/image/shopify-18.png ':size=400')
6. Click `Save`. You can also `Preview` the email.
7. Done.

<summary>Additional Notes</summary>
<article>

##### Cancel and Refund via Shopify admin panel
Within Shopify admin panel's order details view, there are actions of `cancel` and `refund`. When triggering `cancel` or `refund`, Midtrans order status will try to sync with the Shopify status, if it met the criteria for payment cancel or refund.

For example:
- Canceling `pending` order on Shopify, will also make Midtrans order status to be marked as `cancel`.
- Refunding `paid` order on Shopify, will also make Midtrans order status to be marked as `refund`/`cancel`.

Limitations:
- Not all payment methods support online `refund` on Midtrans side, capability is mostly limited to Card & e-money/QRIS transaction.
- Will only works if your Midtrans account is allowed to trigger online refund.
- Shopify's refund UI/UX can be a little bit confusing, after clicking refund it may not tell you whether the refund is successful or not. It only shows `refund processing` which **should not be confused as an indication of success**. You can follow the refund status from the Shopify Order’s timeline. If it is marked as `pending` or failure, the refund is not successful.
- It is more recommended to manage payment refund & cancellation from Midtrans Dashboard instead. As it will have a better indication of refund success and failure.
- `cancel` or `refund` action triggered on Midtrans dashboard/API, may or may not be synced to Shopify due to some limitation.

?> The more accurate payment status is the one shown on Midtrans dashboard. You should refer to it in case there are discrepancies on Shopify's side. Because in some rare case payment status syncing to Shopify's system may fail, and Shopify's order details UI can be confusing to read.

##### Note on Canceling Order
Canceling a paid order will auto trigger attempt to refund/cancel payment on Payment Gateway (Midtrans) side. That is the flow of Shopify that Merchant and Payment Gateway follows. Please avoid canceling a paid order when you mean to edit/customize the item or size.

As per Shopify docs, `cancel order` are not supposed to be used to change item/size:
https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/orders/refund-cancel-order#cancel-an-order

Merchants supposed to `edit order` if they need to change the item/size:
https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/orders/edit-orders

Or archive the order, if they really need to remove it from order list:
https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/orders/manage-orders#archive-a-fulfilled-order

##### Item Stock & Status
Few points to understand about order status & item stock management that is managed automatically with this integration:
- Item stock will be reduced whenever order status become `pending` on Shopify side.
- Item stock will be reduced immediately after the customer reaches Snap payment page, regardless of whether he/she will proceed to actual payment or not. This is to prevent "oversell" issue, by reserving the item stock for the duration of this payment. 
  - To ensure the item stock is allocated for that customer. If that customer decides to abandon payment on Snap payment page, after a certain period the item stock will be released, and marked as canceled on the Shopify side.
  - Example of "oversell" issue prevented by this mechanism: This happens when item stock is 1 left, but there are 2 (or more) customers racing to complete the payment, if both complete the payments, and both are accepted by Shopify, then the item stock will be negative. Which will cause issues on its own. So to prevent this, item stock is reserved (and marked as pending on Shopify side) as early as the customer is redirected to the payment page.
- Card transaction with `deny` status will be updated as failed on Shopify by Midtrans after two hours if left without any success attempt. If success pay attempt is found, it will be updated as success on Shopify.
- Abandoned Snap payment page (customer left without proceeding with any payment method) will be updated as canceled on Shopify after two hours, and will be restocked. Order may not show up in Midtrans Dashboard.
- When customer reaches Snap payment page (status `pending` and stock reduced). Shopify may send email to customer which says "order ready to be shipped", although from Shopify side it is still waiting for payment. Refer to section above about this behavior.
- It is recommended to **avoid manual order status changes (manual intervention)** from Shopify Admin Panel at least between period of the order first created as `pending` and it finally become `paid/canceled` (about 0-26 hours), in order for payment integration with Midtrans to perform smoothly. Which the order status and item stock will be managed automatically based on the flow explained on this page.
  - Manual order status changes may cause unexpected behaviour in terms of order status & item stock management, such as order status stuck at certain state. Do this at your own risk. Midtrans may not be in position to help/explain with the consequences.

##### Basic Status Mapping
Condition | Midtrans Status | Shopify Order Status
--- | --- | ---
Customer redirected to Snap payment page. | \- | Payment Pending
Customer proceeds with asynchronous payment <br>For example: Bank Transfer, Gopay. | Pending | Payment Pending
Customer proceeds with asynchronous payment <br>but does not pay until expiry time reached.<sup>[1]</sup> | Expire | Canceled
Customer successfully makes payment. | Settlement/Capture | Paid
Customer abandoned Snap payment page <br>without proceeding with payment. | \- | Canceled
Customer abandoned or denied card transaction. | Deny | Canceled
Merchant cancels/refunds order via Shopify. | Cancel/Refund | Canceled/Refunded

<br>

<sup>[1]</sup> The expiry time calculation starts at the moment when the customer proceeds with the payment method (not necessarily from when redirected to Snap payment page). The payment expiry will then follow what is defined on Snap Preference for each payment method, you can [customize the Snap Preference](/en/after-payment/dashboard-usage.md#configuring-custom-payment-expiry-settings-on-snap) to your needs. When the payment expiry time is reached and the customer does not complete the payment, the transaction will be updated to `Canceled` on Shopify side & `Expire` on Midtrans side.
