The `redirect_url` retrieved from [Sending transaction data to API](/en/technical-reference/core-api/cardless-credit.md#sending-transaction-data-to-api) is used to redirect the customer to the bank's website.
The customer is then redirected through server-side redirect, using JavaScript like `window.location=[REDIRECT URL]`, or using HTML link `<a href="[REDIRECT URL]">Pay Here!</a>`.
The customer can complete the payment on this page.

For more details, refer to [Testing Payment on Sandbox](/en/technical-reference/sandbox-test.md#cardless-credit).

#### 3. Configuring landing page

After the customer completes the payment, the bank's website redirects the customer to *Finish Redirect URL* which can be configured on MAP (Merchant Administration Portal).
