For more details, refer to [Retrieving API Access Keys](/en/midtrans-account/overview.md#retrieving-api-access-keys).

## Steps for integration
To integrate with *Cardless Credit* payment method, follow the steps given below.

### 1. Sending transaction data to Charge API
The *Charge API* request is sent with the transaction details, from the merchant backend.

#### Request Details

| Environment | Method | URL                                        |
