# Core API Advanced Features
<hr>
<!-- TODO:add sample code for lang other than CURL? -->

Core API has various optional parameters that can be utilized to integrate with more advanced use cases.

## General
### Recommended Parameters
You can  include more information such as `customer_details`, `item_details`, and so on along side `transaction_details`. While sending API requests, it is recommended to send more details regarding the transaction, so that these details will be captured on the transaction record. Which can be [viewed on the Midtrans Dashboard](/en/after-payment/dashboard-usage.md#transaction).

<!-- tabs:start -->

#### **JSON Parameters**
The JSON parameters added in the *Request Body* of a [Charge API Request](/en/core-api/credit-card.md#_2-sending-transaction-data-to-charge-api), to include more details of the transaction, are shown below.

### BIN (Bank Identification Number) Filter
BIN (Bank Identification Number) filter is a feature that allows the merchant to accept only Credit Cards within specific set of BIN numbers. It is useful for certain bank promo/discount payment by accepting only credit cards issued by that bank. BIN (Bank Identification Number) is the **first 1-8 digits of a card number**, which identifies the bank that issues the card. A bank generally has more than one BIN.

To use this feature, accumulate the list of BIN that accepts the promotion or uses the issuing bank's name. This transaction can be performed exclusively by using the credit card that is included in the BIN list or BIN under the particular defined issuing bank.
<!-- tabs:start -->

### Installment Payment
#### Online Installment

*Online Installment* is the type of payment where *Card Issuing Bank* used for making an installment payment and the *Acquiring Bank* are the same. For example, a customer makes an installment payment using BNI Card and the *Acquiring Bank* is also BNI.

For online installments, the bank will issue special MID for installment. This installment MID is used to automatically convert the transaction into installments. To activate the installment feature, you are required to have agreement with the bank. Please consult Midtrans Activation Team for installment MID. If MID is ready, merchant simply needs to add `installment_term` and `bank` parameter.

<!-- tabs:start -->

#### **JSON Parameters**
The JSON parameter added in the *Request Body* of a [Charge API Request](/en/core-api/credit-card.md#_2-sending-transaction-data-to-charge-api) to allow *Online Installment*, is shown below.

</article>
</details>

#### Offline Installment
*Offline Installment* is the type of payment where *Card Issuing Bank* used for making an installment payment and the *Acquiring Bank* need not be the same. For example, a customer makes an installment payment using BNI Card and the *Acquiring Bank* is Mandiri.

To allow installment feature with banks which do not issue Installment MID, merchant can use offline installment feature. With offline installment feature, the transaction will initially be charged in full amount and will be converted into installment later. To activate the installment feature, you are required to have agreement with the bank. Please consult Midtrans Activation Team for installment MID.


You have to add the `installment` parameter with combination of `bins` filter feature. The purpose of BIN filter is to allow only certain acceptable cards to proceed with offline installment payment, based on the agreement between you and issuing banks.

Usually you will also need to add `bank` parameter to specify which card acquirer bank should be used for the offline installment payment.

<!-- tabs:start -->

#### **JSON Parameters**
The JSON parameters added in the *Request Body* of a [Charge API Request](en/core-api/credit-card.md#_2-sending-transaction-data-to-charge-api) to allow *Offline Installment*, are shown below.

```json

    "bins": ["48111111", "3111", "5"],
    "bank": "mandiri"
  }
}
```
#### **Sample Charge API Request**

### Pre-Authorization Payment
*Pre-Authorization* payment feature will temporarily block the fund from the customer's account. The fund is not immediately deducted after the transaction. You can initiate "capture" action through [Capture API](https://api-docs.midtrans.com/#capture-transaction). By default, fund reservation will be released after 7 days if there is no "capture" action for that transaction.

## Credit Card - Save Card (Tokenization)

?> This feature is also known as Card Tokenization. Which simply means a method to replace sensitive information value (card credentials) with a `token` (a placeholder) value, but also allowing it to still be associated with the actual value. Generally to keep sensitive information safely kept within secure environments, but still accessible for authorized parties.

### Two Click Transaction
You can allow customer to save their card credentials, for easier and faster future transactions. Two Clicks means there will be additional step which require customer to input CVV (and also conditionally 3DS/OTP process). Which basically means abput two-step away to trigger the payment: input CVV, and then initiate payment.

Midtrans saves the card credentials securely on Midtrans side, and give you the token associated to that card. You need to store and associate each customer with a unique `saved_token_id` that will be retrieved from the first Charge API Response.

?> Note: This feature requires no additional MID from acquiring bank, this utilize your regular card MID. If you already integrate with regular card payment on Midtrans, then you are eligible to use this feature.

<details>
<summary><b>Sequence Diagram</b></summary>
<article>
The Two Clicks end-to-end payment process is illustrated in following sequence diagram:

![one click sequence diagram](../../asset/image/core_api-sequence_two_clicks.png)
</article>
</details>

To configure *Two Clicks* transaction for a customer, follow the steps given below.

#### Retrieving the `token_id`
The `token_id` is a representation of customer's card information used for the transaction. The `token_id` is retrieved using [MidtransNew3ds JS library](/en/core-api/credit-card.md#including-midtrans-js-library) on merchant frontend. Merchant frontend JavaScript securely transmits card information to Midtrans Core API in exchange of the card `token_id`. This avoids the risk of card information being transmitted to merchant backend.

For more details, refer to [Getting the Card Token](/en/core-api/credit-card.md#_1-getting-the-card-token).

#### Charge API Request for the First Transaction
The `token_id` retrieved is added as an attribute in `credit_card` object in the *Request Body* during [Charge API Request](/en/core-api/bank-transfer.md#charge-api-request).

<!-- tabs:start -->

#### **JSON Parameters**
The JSON parameter added in the *Request Body* of a Charge API Request to allow *Two-Click* transaction, is shown below.

```json
{
  "payment_type": "credit_card",
  "transaction_details": {
    "order_id": "CustOrder-102",
    "gross_amount": 10000
  },
  "credit_card": {
  "token_id": "<token_id from Get Card Token Step>",
  "authentication": true,
  "save_token_id": true     // <-- To flag that token is saved during First charge response
  }
}
```

#### **Sample Charge API Request**
The JSON attribute ` save_token_id`, included in the sample Charge API Request is shown below.

```bash
curl -X POST \
  https://api.sandbox.midtrans.com/v2/charge \
  -H 'Accept: application/json'\
  -H 'Authorization: Basic <YOUR SERVER KEY ENCODED in Base64>' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
  "payment_type": "credit_card",
  "transaction_details": {
    "order_id": "CustOrder-102",

  },
  "credit_card": {
  "token_id": "<token_id from Get Card Token Step>",
  "authentication": true,
  "save_token_id": true
  }
}'
```

#### Sample Charge API Response for the First Transaction
The Charge API response includes the `redirect_url`.

```json
{
    "status_code": "201",
    "status_message": "Success, Credit Card transaction is successful",
    "transaction_id": "47df99ca-f997-41bd-864e-8598ccf2fc27",

    "masked_card": "48111111-1114",
    "bank": "mandiri",
    "card_type": "credit"
}
```

?>***Note***: The `transaction_status` is *Pending*.

<!-- tabs:end -->

#### Opening 3DS Authentication Page for the First Transaction
To open 3DS authentication page on merchant frontend, display the `redirect_url` retrieved from Charge API Response for the First Transaction. The redirect URL is displayed using `MidtransNew3ds.authenticate` or `MidtransNew3ds.redirect` function in [MidtransNew3DS JS library](/en/core-api/credit-card.md#including-midtrans-js-library).

 When the customer completes the transaction, the *Transaction Status* changes from *Pending* to *Capture*.

 For more details, refer to [Open 3DS Authenticate Page JS Implementation](/en/core-api/credit-card.md#open-3ds-authenticate-page-js-implementation).


Midtrans notifies the merchant backend with the new `transaction status` and `saved_token_id`.

#### Sample Response for 3DS authentication for the First Transaction

```json
{
  "status_code": "200",
  "status_message": "Success, Credit Card transaction is successful",

</details>

#### Getting Card Token For Future Transactions
The `saved_token_id` from the previous step, is used in this step.

To retrieve card `token_id`, use `MidtransNew3ds.getCardToken` function. Implement the following JavaScript on payment page.
```javascript
// card data from customer input, for example
var cardData = {
  "token_id": <saved_token_id from Two Clicks first transaction response>,
  "card_cvv": 123,
};

// callback functions
var options = {
  onSuccess: function(response){
    // Success to get card token_id, implement as you wish here
    console.log('Success to get card token_id, response:', response);
    var token_id = response.token_id;
    console.log('This is the card token_id:', token_id);
  },
  onFailure: function(response){
    // Fail to get card token_id, implement as you wish here
    console.log('Fail to get card token_id, response:', response);
  }
};

// trigger `getCardToken` function
MidtransNew3ds.getCardToken(cardData, options);
```
?>***Note***: You need `saved_token_id` retrieved from database.<br>For successful transactions,the `token_id` is received inside `onSuccess` callback function. It will be used as one of the JSON parameters for Charge API request.

### Recurring/One Click Transaction
You can allow the customer to save their card credentials, for future transactions. One Click means there will be no additional step like inputting CVV or 3DS/OTP process presented to the customer. Which basically means only need one-step away to trigger the payment. Whether it is initiated by you (as merchant) or the customer.

This adds to a better customer experience. Midtrans saves the card credentials securely on Midtrans side, and give you the token associated to that card. You need to store and associate each customer with a unique `saved_token_id` that will be retrieved from the first Charge API Response.

?> Note: This feature requires special MID from acquiring bank, this utilize what bank usually call as "recurring MID". Which may means additional business agreement with the acquiring bank, you should consult Midtrans Activation team to activate this feature.

| saved_token_id_expired_at | Expiry date and time of the Token ID. It is in the format YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS | String | --   |

</article>
</details>

You will receive `saved_token_id` & `saved_token_id_expired_at` from the response (it also available in the JSON of HTTP notification). `saved_token_id` is unique for each customer's card. Store this `saved_token_id` in your database and associate that card token to your customer.

!> Important: Be sure to store the card's `saved_token_id_expired_at`. When that date time has been surpassed, the card's `saved_token_id` will be no longer usable, it means the card is expired. In that case you will need to ask your customer to re-do the card saving process with their re-newed card.

#### Charge API Request for Recurring Transactions

For recurring transactions by the customer, use `saved_token_id` retrieved previously (or from your database) as the value of `token_id` attribute, while sending [Charge API Request](/en/core-api/credit-card.md#_2-sending-transaction-data-to-charge-api).

### Recurring Transaction with Register Card API
You can allow the customer to save their card credentials, then it requires no CVV input and 3DS/OTP for future transactions. Midtrans saves the card credentials securely on Midtrans side, and give you the token associated to that card. You need to store and associate each customer with a unique `saved_token_id` that will be retrieved from Register Card API Response.

#### Register Card via MidtransNew3ds JS
To save card credentials on Midtrans and retrieve card's `saved_token_id`, use `MidtransNew3ds.registerCard` through [MidtransNew3ds JS library](/en/core-api/credit-card.md#including-midtrans-js-library). Implement the following JavaScript on the payment page.

```javascript
// Create the card object with the required fields
var cardData = {
    card_number: "4811111111111114",
    card_cvv: "123",
    card_exp_month: "12",
    card_exp_year: "2025"
};

var options = {
    onSuccess: function(response) {
        // Implement success handling here, save the `saved_token_id` to your database
        console.log('Saved Token ID:',response.saved_token_id);
    },
    onFailure: function(response) {
        // Implement error handling here
        console.log('Fail to get saved card token',response.status_message);
    }
}

MidtransNew3ds.registerCard(cardData, options);

```
Frontend implementation via JS is used to ensure card credentials is securely passed from customer browser directly to Midtrans API.

<details>
<summary><b>Alternative: via API Request</b></summary>

    "transaction_id": "cbd3ff55-2ead-43e9-84c5-5c3b7a8a1814",
    "masked_card": "52111111-1117"
}
```
<!-- tabs:end -->

Store `saved_token_id` received in the response body, to your database.

#### Getting Card Token for the First Transaction
Using `saved_token_id` from step above, the `token_id` is retrieved using `MidtransNew3ds.getCardToken` through [MidtransNew3ds JS library](/en/core-api/credit-card.md#including-midtrans-js-library). Implement the following JavaScript on the payment page.

```javascript
// card data from customer input, for example
var cardData = {
  "token_id": <saved_token_id from Register Card API Response Step>,
  "card_cvv": 123,
};

// callback functions
var options = {
  onSuccess: function(response){
    // Success to get card token_id, implement as you wish here
    console.log('Success to get card token_id, response:', response);
    var token_id = response.token_id;
    console.log('This is the card token_id:', token_id);
  },
  onFailure: function(response){
    // Fail to get card token_id, implement as you wish here
    console.log('Fail to get card token_id, response:', response);
  }
};

// trigger `getCardToken` function
MidtransNew3ds.getCardToken(cardData, options);
```
For successful transactions, `token_id` is received inside `onSuccess` callback function. It is used as one of the JSON parameters for [Charge API request](#sending-transaction-data-to-charge-api-for-the-first-transaction).

#### Sending Transaction Data to Charge API for the First Transaction

### Recurring Transaction with Subscriptions API

Note that the [One Click feature mentioned above](#recurringone-click-transaction) is relying on your system/backend to schedule and trigger the recurring charges. Additionally, Midtrans also **support automatically charge recurring for you based on your specified schedule**. Which is described on this section.

Follow the same implementation as [mentioned above](#recurringone-click-transaction), to the point your system [retrieved the `saved_token_id`](#sample-3ds-authenticate-json-response-for-the-first-transaction). Then you can proceed with [Core API's Recurring API feature here](https://api-docs.midtrans.com/#subscription-api). To specify the schedule of when Midtrans should charge recurringly to your customer.

?> Note: This feature requires special MID from acquiring bank, this utilize what bank usually call as "recurring MID". Which may means additional business agreement with the acquiring bank, you should consult Midtrans Activation team to activate this feature.

Virtual Account number displayed to customer contains two parts; the company-prefix-number and the second part is a unique-va-number. The table given below, explains this with an example.

| Virtual Account Number | Company Number | Unique VA Number  |
| ---------------------- | ------------ | ------------ |
| `{91012}{12435678}`    | `{91012}`    | `{12435678}` |

The unique code can be customized.

Rules for customizing Virtual Account number is given below.

* Only digits are allowed.
* Different banks have different specifications for their custom VA numbers. Please go through the documentation of the respective banks. Note: for **Permata, only B2B VA type** support custom VA numbers, so by default your sandbox account may not support Permata custom VA, please contact us if you wish to have this feature.
* If the number provided is currently active for another order, then a different unique number will be used instead.
* If the number provided is longer than required, then the unnecessary digits in the end will be trimmed.
* If the number provided is shorter than required, then the number will be prefixed with zeros.

?>***Note***: In *Production* environment, not every bank may support custom VA number (e.g. Permata) as the default state. It depends on the type of VA configured for your merchant account & your business agreement with the bank. Please consult Midtrans Activation team for further information.

## Consideration and Limitations
There are a few limitations to consider while using Midtrans API. These limitations are given below.

- ### Maximum Request Size Limit

Midtrans API allows a maximum size of 16kb or 16000 total characters per request. Please try to keep it under the limit to avoid request failures.

?>***Tips***: Limit the number of `item_details` from your request, or group it into fewer `item_details`.

- ### Card Token ID Expiry Time

For regular card transactions, the `token_id` (for non-recurring, non-one-click, non-two-click token) and the 3DS `redirect_url` expires in **10 minutes**.

For security reasons, it is designed to generate a unique `token_id` for each transaction. Please make sure to complete the card transaction within the time limit to avoid expired `token_id`.
