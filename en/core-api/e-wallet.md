# Core API E-Money Integration

<hr>

?>***Note:*** This payment method is compatible with [QR Code Indonesian Standard (QRIS)](https://www.bi.go.id/QRIS/default.aspx), and can be paid with **any QRIS compatible e-Money or banking app**.

GoPay is an *E-Money* payment method by Gojek. Users can pay using the Gojek-GoPay app, or any QRIS compatible app. The user flow is different for web browser (on a computer or a tablet) and smartphone:

1. **QR Code** - This is the user flow on a web browser (on a computer or a tablet). User is shown a QR code and asked to scan using any QRIS compatible app, such as Gojek-GoPay app.
2. **Deeplink** - This is the user flow on a SmartPhone/mobile device. User gets redirected to the Gojek-GoPay app to finish payment.

?>***Note:*** Please make sure to create your [Midtrans account](/en/midtrans-account/overview.md), before proceeding with this section.

## Sandbox Environment
The steps given below use [Midtrans *Sandbox* environment](https://account.midtrans.com/) to test the integration process. Please make sure that you use the *Server Key* and *Client Key* for the *Sandbox* environment. For more details, refer to [Retrieving API Access Keys](/en/midtrans-account/overview.md#retrieving-api-access-keys).

Basic integration process of GoPay is explained in this section.

## Steps for Integration
To integrate with *E-Money* Payment method, follow the steps given below.

## 1. Sending Transaction Data to API Charge
API request should be done from merchant backend to acquire QR code and deeplink URL to Gojek-GoPay app. The table given below describes the various elements required for sending the transaction data to the *Charge API*.  

| Requirement    | Description                                                  |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Server Key     | The server key. For more details, refer to [Retrieving API Access Keys](/en/midtrans-account/overview.md#retrieving-api-access-keys). |
| `order_id`     | The order_id of the transaction.                             |
| `gross_amount` | The total amount of transaction.                             |
| `payment_type` | The payment method. Note: Here, set to `gopay`               |

#### Sample Request
The sample *Charge API request* implementation is given below.  You can choose/implement according to your backend language. For more details, refer to available [Language Libraries](/en/technical-reference/library-plugin.md#language-library).

## 2. Altering Payment Flow Depending on the Device Used
Depending on which platform (Desktop or Mobile) you are integrating this payment method for your customer to pay, the payment flow will be different between *computer/tablet* versus *smartphone/mobile*. Choose from the flows below accordingly.
### Show QR Code Image (on computer or tablet)
To display transaction QR Code image, use the URL from `generate-qr-code` actions retrieved from API response. Simplest way is to **"hotlink"** the image URL. If the frontend is HTML, put the URL in image tag `<img src="THE_QR_CODE_URL_HERE">`, or display it on a similar component downloading.

If the frontend does not support such scenario, you may need to locally download the QR code image from that URL, then display it on your frontend.

Once the QR Code for payment is displayed to customer, it will be available for customer to pay.

?> Read [here to simulate/test success payment on Sandbox](/en/technical-reference/sandbox-test.md#e-money).

Payment flow example for customer on Production environment:

1. On Merchant web/app, choose **GoPay/QRIS** as payment method.
2. Continue checkout until the payment QR code displayed.
3. Open any **QRIS compatible app**, installed in your phone, for example Gojek-GoPay.
4. Use "Scan to Pay" feature to scan the **QR code**.
5. Click **Pay**, after checking and verifying your payment details.
6. You may be prompted to input **Security PIN** to finish your transaction.

![GoPay QR Instruction](./../../asset/image/core-api_gopay-qr-pay.png)

### Redirecting to Gojek-GoPay App Deeplink (on smartphone)
To redirect the customer to Gojek-GoPay app, use URL from `deeplink-redirect` actions retrieved from API response. Then customer can be redirected via server-side redirect, using JavaScript, such as `window.location=[DEEPLINK URL]`, or using HTML link, `<a href="[DEEPLINK URL]">Pay with GoPay</a>`.

?> Read [here to simulate/test success payment on Sandbox](/en/technical-reference/sandbox-test.md#e-money).

Payment flow example for customer on Production Environment:

1. On Merchant web/app, choose **GoPay** as payment method.
2. Continue checkout until you are redirected to **Gojek-GoPay** app.
3. Click **Pay**, after checking and verifying your payment details.
4. You may be prompted to input **Security PIN** to finish your transaction.

![GoPay QR Instruction](./../../asset/image/core-api_gopay-deeplink-pay.png)

#### Implementing Finish Redirect Callback Handler
In addition to app deeplink flow above, you can optionally implement finish redirect callback. Which after payment, the customer will be redirected back from Gojek-GoPay to your app.

Add the following parameters within the `gopay` object in the [Charge API request](#sample-request).
```json
  "gopay": {
      "enable_callback": true,
      "callback_url": "tokokuapp://gopay-finish"
  }
  //you can also use web url like "https://myshop.com/gopay-finish"
```
| JSON Attribute | Description |
| -------------- | ----------- |
| enable_callback | To determine whether customer will be redirected to the callback URL after payment. Default value: `false`. |
| callback_url | To determine where Gojek-GoPay app will redirect customer after payment. Can be HTTP or app deeplink URL. Default value: `callback_url` in dashboard settings. |

You will need to implement callback url handler on your web/app. Customer will be redirected to this URL once payment is completed. The redirect will also automatically appended with query parameters below.

| Parameter | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| order_id | Order ID sent on the Charge Request|
| result | Result of the transaction to decide what kind of page to show to customer. Possible values: `success` or `failure`|

The final url will become for example `tokokuapp://gopay-finish?order_id=123&result=success`. So make sure your app can handle the finish redirect url properly.

?>***Note*** : To update the **Transaction Status** on merchant backend/database, **do not** solely rely on frontend callbacks. For security reasons, to make sure that the **Transaction Status** is authentically coming from Midtrans, you can update **Transaction Status** by waiting for [HTTP Notification](/en/after-payment/http-notification.md) or timely call [API Get Status](/en/after-payment/get-status) on your backend.

If you don't implement finish redirect callback, after payment completed, customer can manually dismiss GoPay success/failure screen, then navigate back to your app manually.

## 3. Handling Post-Transaction
When the transaction status changes, Midtrans notifies you at the *Redirect URL* and sends HTTP notification to the merchant backend. This ensures that you are updated of the transaction status securely.

HTTP POST request with JSON body will be sent to your server's *Notification URL* configured on dashboard.

| deny | Transaction is rejected by the payment provider. |
| refund | Transaction is refunded by you. |

## Additional Notes
#### Allowing App Redirect for Mobile Platform App
If app deeplink redirect method is being used within WebView, you may need to include additional configurations to ensure that your app will be able to redirect customer to Gojek-GoPay app. Please make sure that the WebView allows opening app redirect link urls.

<!-- tabs:start -->

#### **Android Native**
On **Android** if using WebView, please make sure that the WebView allows opening other app redirect link urls.

As a reference/example please follow [this FAQ on how to allow Gojek-GoPay app redirect link.](/en/other/faq/technical.md#android)

#### **iOS Native**
On **iOS** if using WebView, please make sure that the WebView allows opening other app redirect link urls.

As a reference/example please follow [this FAQ on how to allow Gojek-GoPay app redirect link.](/en/other/faq/technical.md#ios-webview-specific)

#### **WebView & Other**
If you are using other framework such as React Native, Flutter, etc. Please follow [this FAQ on how to allow Gojek-GoPay app redirect link.](/en/other/faq/technical.md#customer-fails-to-be-redirected-to-gojek-deeplink-on-mobile-app-what-should-i-do)

<!-- tabs:end -->
<br>

Link: [*More detailed definition of transaction_status & fraud_status*](/en/after-payment/status-cycle.md)

#### Making Sure App Redirect Works on Web Based Mobile Platform App
If you are implementing redirect using web based code (Browser, PWA, React Native, within WebView, etc.) on a Mobile App, sometimes the platform may block you from redirecting customer to another app. 

Please follow [this FAQ on how to allow deep/universal link redirect.](/en/other/faq/technical.md#customer-fails-to-be-redirected-to-gojek-deeplink-on-mobile-app-what-should-i-do)

#### Payment via QRIS
Please note that **if the payment transaction is paid by customer via QRIS** scanning method, then:
- Midtrans will send **webhook/HTTP notification with `"payment_type": "qris"` instead of `gopay`**. This is to indicate that the payment is via QRIS.

Please **ensure that your system can handle this behavior**, although it may seem unusual that you send payment_type as `gopay` but may receive back as `qris`.
