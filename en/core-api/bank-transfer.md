## Specifying VA Number

Virtual Account number which is displayed to customer, contains two parts. for example, in `{91012}{12435678}` , the first part is the company code and the second part is a unique code. The second part can be customized (For **Permata** B2B agreement model is supported). Following conditions need to be followed while customizing VA number:

* Only digits are allowed.
* Different banks have different specifications for their custom VA numbers. Please go through the documentation of the respective banks.
* If the number provided is already utilized for another order, then a different unique number will be used instead.
* If the number provided is longer than required, then the unnecessary digits in the end will be trimmed.
* If the number provided is shorter than required, then the number will be prefixed with zeros.

Midtrans creates a random VA number for transaction using *Bank Transfer* payment method. You can customize this VA Number, by adding  `bank_transfer` parameters in the Charge API Request Body as shown below.

Please add **bank_transfer** parameter during [Charge API Request](/en/core-api/bank-transfer.md?id=sample-request-and-request-body).
